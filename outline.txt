1 Designing for Mobile (Both)
When do you choose the web stack over native
Site versus package (do you really need an app?) 
What use cases from your app are going to be on a website versus in an app
What processing are you going to do on the client
Image sizing
JavaScript
Intuitive

Start with CSS media queries
Then ask… do you want to do it this way?
Then look at Bootstrap
